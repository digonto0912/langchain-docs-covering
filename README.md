#Chain Integration for NLP Applications

This project demonstrates the use of LangChain, a powerful framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). LangChain allows for seamless integration of language models with various external data sources, facilitating the creation of intelligent and complex NLP-driven applications. The project leverages LangChain's capabilities to chain together different components such as document loaders, model wrappers, and prompt templates to create a comprehensive NLP workflow.

Key features:

1. LLM Integration: Using LangChain to connect to various language models like GPT-3/4 for tasks such as question answering, summarization, and text generation.
2. Document Loading & Retrieval: Employing LangChain's document loaders to extract and process data from multiple sources like text files, PDFs, and websites.
3. Custom Prompt Templates: Designing dynamic prompts with LangChain to customize language model responses based on specific use cases.
4. Advanced Workflow Integration: Building complex workflows where the outputs of one model or process feed into another, creating a multi-step NLP pipeline.

Technologies Used:

- Python
- LangChain (for LLM integration and workflows)
- OpenAI API (for language models)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- Flask/FastAPI (optional for creating a web-based interface)
